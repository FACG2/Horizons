  << Sketches Links >>


Our plan was to divide the work between Us to achieve the page that Satisfy the User Stories
  So we have Shown the Sketches the Work Plan Goes as Follow :
    - Hana : Built the Header Section , Choose the brand and the logo.
    - Moath : Was Responsible for the Team Section and Compatibility with Different Devices.
    - Ghadeer : She Did the Contact Form and the Footer .
    - Eslam : the Sketches ,merging and fixing it's issues and The Documentation.



    So one of us created the repository Horizons ,and every one created a branch to do his part
    after doing our tasks we merged the branches where we faced a lot of issues of conflicting.
    Some of the issues that We faced:
      - a lot of conflicts happens in the style sheet because we all work on the same file,
        targeting the elements was also wrong,which affecting others work.
      - We did not Know that We have to pull to update our copy of the project.
      - Issues using github We lost files!!
